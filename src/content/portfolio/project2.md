description: I created this video in collaboration with the team at The American
  Nuclear Society. This was my first experience with stock footage! The gravity
  and depth of this video required me to deep-dive head-first into the stock
  footage world. Surprisingly, I was able to use a lot of free stock footage,
  combined with clever editing and color. I also took historical photographs and
  created a parallax effect to bring them to life. Needless to say my client was
  very impressed!
