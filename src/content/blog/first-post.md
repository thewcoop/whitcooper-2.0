# Adventure of a Lifetime

Something about the islands... it just feels right to be there. I think it has something to do with the abundance of color and the breeze. We started our journey on the Island of Tortola. We got our groceries... I mean... provisions, and got the hell out of there.

From here it was smoooooth sailing to The Bight, where we attended two action-packed and drastically different nights at Willie T's – a famous floating ship bar.\
The first night was the afterparty for "Christmas in July," an extremely popular local festival. Needless to say this place was off-the-walls. People throwing food, yelling, jumping off the roof into the water. It was awesome–we didn't stay for long.
