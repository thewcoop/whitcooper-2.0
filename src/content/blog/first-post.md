# Adventure of a Lifetime

Something about the islands... it just feels right to be there. I think it has something to do with the abundance of color and the breeze. We started our journey on the Island of Tortola. We got our groceries... I mean... provisions, and got the hell out of there.

From here it was smoooooth sailing to The Bight, where we attended two action-packed and drastically different nights at Willie T's – a famous floating ship bar. We took our dingy.\
The first night was the afterparty for "Christmas in July," an extremely popular local festival. Needless to say this place was off-the-walls. People throwing food, yelling, jumping off the roof into the water. It was awesome–we didn't stay for long.

We spent one more even-more-fun night here. They had some really good food, and it was really fun watching people pull up on their fancy boats.

Cooper Island

Obviously we (the Cooper family) HAD to go check out *our* island! In true Cooper fashion, this island is known for its Rum Bar, which supposedly has more rums than any other! A man can only drink so much :( but check out these awesome boardwalks.

Bonus points to whoever can find our sticker! We hid it right on the beach.
